## About us

Neuroimaging research can involve complex and often resource-intensive pipelines to go from data acquisition to the generation of results. The purpose of this group is to better understand the environmental costs of these research pipelines and develop tools to help reduce these costs. 

Key tasks of this workgroup are:
* *Assessing* environmental *impact* of neuroimaging research pipelines
* *Investigating* how these impacts can be *minimised* 
* *Exploring* pathways to *sustainable* neuroimaging research
* *Providing resources* for practitioners to calculate the environmental impacts of their research
* *Develop research pipelines* that have a reduced environmental impact

## Who are we?

We are a workgroup under the [Sustainability and Environment Action Special Interest Group](https://ohbm-environment.org/) formed by the Organisation for Human Brain Mapping [(OHBM)](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/) in 2020. The workgroup itself was constituted in 2021.
