## Pipelines

The large amount of complex processing steps in neuroimaging analysis makes the use of pipelines and automatisation necessary. Due to the existence of a variety of options these processes have been shown to contribute to the reproducibility crisis [1,2]. 

In our subgroup we aim to streamline neuroimaging pipelines to promote reproducibility and  sustainable practices by:
* Encouraging sharing of data, meta data and the complete pipelines used
* Promoting transparency of code and dependencies inherent to the pipelines
* Facilitating reproducibility of specific pipelines by promoting dockers and neuroimaging data structures like (BIDS)[https://bids.neuroimaging.io/] [3]
* Providing pipelines and practices that focus on reducing the overall carbon footprint
